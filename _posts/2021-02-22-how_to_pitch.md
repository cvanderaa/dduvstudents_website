This post is a brief summary of the workshop held during the virtual 
FORUM PRO 2021. The workshop was given by Camille Wuidar (UpSkill) and
Guillaume Thieffry (UCLouvain). There are three main pillars that 
allow for an efficient pitch: 

- The form
- The content
- The personal presentation

An efficient speech should not last longer than 2 minutes, that's the
absolute maximum! Also, keep in mind that at most 30 % of your speech
will be effectively received by your audience.
